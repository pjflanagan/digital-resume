- [ ] NEED a rollerblade somewhere
- [ ] use data through graphql and context
- [!] use some functions just for fun
- [ ] content should be done with CONTEXT, only at top level, or graphql

- [!] make it so you can go tab through the whole site seamlessly

LANDING
- [ ] switch to typescript and redo this file?
- [ ] make the canvas pause and play based on where the scroll is
