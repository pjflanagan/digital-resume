A website that I've had an idea for for a long time was this silly app. I finally decided it was worth doing because serverless functions have become popular and I wouldn't need to pay for a server to make this work.

The app finds the weather at your location, takes the number of drinks you've had, and tells you what it feels like. It also finds fun gifs for the background and tells you funny phrases as you add to your drink count.

> Please drink responsibly
