In college, my house had a whiteboard my friends and I would write notes to each other on. In general, whiteboards are an important part of the college experience, from classrooms to dorm rooms.

Before graduation, I rushed to create a digital experience of a group whiteboard. I created a simple socket drawing app called Witebord.

## Next Steps

I want to add a login with Facebook feature to this app. Once logged in, users would be able enter a board for any group chat they're in. After that, I want to make the board save as an image to reimport later. This will allow two things:

- joining a room late will have the latest image
- re-opening a room after all users have left will reload the last drawing
