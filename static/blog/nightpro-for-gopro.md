### A Python package for merging nightlapse photos intoÂ video

## Project Reasons

GoPro nightlapses are wonderful. But they save oddly. Rather than saving as a single video, the way other GoPro timelapses do, they save as individual photos.

Merging them all into one requires a tedious ffmpeg command. NightPro is a wrapper for ffmpeg that turns all the nightlapse photo series in a folder into videos just by running nightpro once.
