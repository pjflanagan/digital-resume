In 2023, I felt like revisiting what made my like coding in the first place: it can be used to make art. So I compiled and improved some of my favorite animations I've made, and added a few more. I intend to build tools here to help me make more animations in the future, and use this webpage to challenge myself to create more beautiful things.
