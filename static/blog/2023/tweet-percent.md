After Elon Musk bought Twitter, he quickly implemented a view count tracker. This was in response to his fanboys desire to see their reach, which they believe was not reflected in the like and retweet count. Essentially, like most social media, they'd feel better if they got to see a bigger number. 

This Chrome extension is designed to curtail that excitement by displaying likes and retweets as a percent of total views.
