## Tutorial

### Step 1: Download the code

All of the code for this tutorial is in one `index.html` file.

### Step 2: Understanding the HTML and CSS

This tutorial will not cover HTML

### Step 3: Understanding the Javascript

## About

I think Javascript is an excellent starter programming language for many reasons:

- Anyone who uses a computer has probably seen a webpage already (100% of people who have read this are online)
- It is straightforward to read
- It can accomplish a lot with little understanding

After a tiny amount of HTML setup, a first time programmer can create and customize a canvas animation. In fact, one of the first tutorials I ever followed and understood was this [Glazing ribbon screensaver effect in HTML5 canvas](https://codepen.io/quatmo/pen/uFqoi) on Codepen. I also wanted to write a tutorial for a first time programmer to experiment with. -->
