Inspired by Wordle, I decided to create my own daily game. Basing off of a game I had developed before, I created a new scoring and puzzle generation system, as well as changing up the style. I created OhWord!?.

This was the most intense I've ever focused on a side project, I had Cypress and Jest tests, I had analytics set up with event nomenclature. I had a redis database and admin page.
