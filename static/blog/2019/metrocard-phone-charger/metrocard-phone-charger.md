I used to have a phone with wireless charging enabled.

## Components

I went to a very exciting store near me called Tinkersphere and found they had the parts for a wireless charger. The circuit board and coil together were about the width and length of a MetroCard, so I bought the parts and went home to construct a wooden prototype.

## Prototype

Using scrap wood, and exacto knige, and hot glue, I pieced together a working version of the charger.

I also made sure to glue the indicator light close to the hole in the MetroCard.

## Print

Using OnShape I created a [model of the phone charger casing](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fe9a14ca0d7527d5d24e40f3/w/387d63da11f34da1257b0e9e/e/014e7bec234688533692fc05?fbclid=IwAR2KqT-QdLNaNoCOsT2Mom-XuLLP4sdTq22zFEmM5aI33Dw0zU4WSYTFZCU).

And I sent them off to a friend who has access to a 3D printer.

The model linked to and depicted above is version 2 of the printed model. I added:
- A platform within the circular housing for the coil
- A bottom (in the original the bottom is a second MetroCard)
- No notch on a corner in order to fit standard cards

## Final Build 

After some glue and paint, the wireless charger came together.
