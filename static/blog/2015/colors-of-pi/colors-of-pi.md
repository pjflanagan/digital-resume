## Version 1

### [Visit the Site](https://www.flanny.app/colors-of-pi/archive/v1/)

![Code](/blog/2015/colors-of-pi/pi-code.jpg)

The first version of this site was made in Python. The code would parse a text file containing pi, and then insert styled `<div>` tags into an html page.

The result was pretty. Since, I was using hexadecimal colors, all of the colors ended up being dark. This was because pi never contained any `A-F` characters and couldn't make a color brighter than `#999999`.

I was thrilled with the results, so I had to host it online somewhere. I found a site that gave me a very untrustworthy looking url.

### SNL Appearance

I am convinced that SNL used my website as a background during their sketch "Meet Your Second Wife." Take a look for yourself:

## Version 2 

### [Visit the Site](https://www.flanny.app/colors-of-pi/)

Years later, I felt compelled to rebuild the site so that it wasn't just one huge html file.
