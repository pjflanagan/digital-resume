Middle school computer apps class was where my intrest for the web started. In 7th grade we had to start and maintain a blog. This was before many of us had Facebook accounts, so all of our after school communication was sharing links on AIM and forwarding emails. I was thrilled whenever I posted things that got shared.

In 8th grade, I found my love for web design. We had to create a simple HTML page in Dreamweaver about an endangered species. 

## 08. Fractal Geometry

Using the baisc header, footer, two sidebar, and centered content template Dreamweaver starts out with, I created a simple webpage with all the bells and whistles of the 2000s like cursor animations and page transitions. The website was about Fractal Geometry...

The website won second place at states.

## 09. Franz Kafka

In freshman year, I did a project about Franz Kafka. I decided to go for a realistic look, with papers and journals and pens on a desk.

## 10. Atomic Theory

After taking a class about Flash animations, I knew I had to incorporate flash into my next project. I designed a one-page click-to-scroll website where information widgets would slide out a bottom portal and through a top portal.

## 11. Physics

The one-page click-to-scroll became a favorite of mine. I was inspired by other paralax sites that had become popular at the time, and I came up with the idea of following an apple downward while the rest of the webpage scrolled up around it.

The website placed second at states.

## 12. Censorship

This was my most ambitious website yet. Another one-page click-to-scroll paralax site, but this time I teamed up with a friend to help create the graphics.

This website made it to states. I never was best in state.
