This was the first personal project I ever hosted on the internet. I never liked run tracking software, and was disappointed with the appearance of most online pace calculators. So I built my own.

## v1: Index.html

In the first version, I wrote all the code in Dreamweaver in one single index file.

## v2: Bootstrap

After learning more, I broke the code out into files with functions, and used a framework and jQuery

## v3: Svelte PWA

In the most up to date version, I got the app to be where I always wanted it to be: as an installable app. I experimented with a very lightweight framework called Svelte and realized that I don't like it that much, but found it interesting.
