### (through the lense of multi-linear story telling)

I recently developed a game and game engine for writing playable stories. It's a relatively simple app that and gameplay experience. The story teller writes dialog, gives the player options to respond, and then defines the outcome for each response. The gameplay experience involves reading the dialog, choosing an option, and seeing where the story goes from there. There are other aspects to the game, like recording story events, points, inventory items, random dialog, rolling dice, background images, and text styling, but the core of the game is just a playable story. 

Now, since this is 2025 and and AI is all the rage, many suggestions from play-testers and friends involve using AI. I also I have plenty of ideas for how to integrate AI into this app. Some of those ideas include:
1. Use an LLM to read user inputted responses and respond accordingly
2. Use an AI image generator to create background images based on scene and character descriptions
3. Use an AI audio generator to speak dialog for the game
4. Use an LLM to understand and make suggestions in the story (for things like continuity corrections or character consistency)
5. Use an LLM to assist with the mundane aspects of the editing process

I want to go over each of these ideas and which I consider to be good uses of AI and which I consider to be bad (hint, they are in order of the ones I find most to least offensive).

## 1. LLM for generated dialog and responses

One of the first suggestions I get when showing this game to people is that I could use AI to allow the user to type anything they want, and then the AI would come up with a response. I understand the desire, they have ideas about how to explore the world that wasn't presented as a choice.

Gaming, while often viewed as a solo experience, is actually all about interacting with a person. When Mario runs into a wall, it's because a person put that wall there. Adding an LLM for responses makes the game no longer story telling in a human way, it is simply getting a computer to.

You should feel a connection to the writer, that they would have presented you an option that you would be tempting for you to click, or one that you find disgusting.

## 2. AI image and audio generation

The game I'm making is pretty graphic light. There's no sprites moving. But there are backgrounds. And it would be time consuming, but I'd love for some games to have background reminiscent of ___, where the character says their dialog and has a little graphic for it. It's very tempting to use AI to generate all these images. A user could enter a description for their character, accept a base model, and then regenerate the same character for each emotion they'd have to express and each setting they'd have to visit. AI character continuity has gotten better and better.

I personally don't think user's should be doing this. If they want to do it manually, they are able to. But I won't be building that feature into this website.

Audio is where I start to become a little more sympathetic to AI usage. For accessability reasons, audio for dialog and narration would be wonderful. And it would be great to use AI to make the audio consistent for each character. I just don't love that audio can be used for deepfakes and nefarious reasons, so I think I'd stay away from it.

## 3. Story editor companion

Now this is a type of AI I am excited about.
