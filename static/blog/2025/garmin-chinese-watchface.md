This year I bought a Garmin to help me train for a half marathon (and hopefully a full marathon in the future).
I like some of the watchfaces available on the the Garmin store, including a watchface I found that displays the
time in Chinese. 

Drawing with the Garmin SDK is a lot like the HTML5 Canvas, so I felt like I could add some decorations to the watchface I already liked.
