This year I bought a Garmin to help me train for a half marathon (and hopefully a full marathon in the future).
I have a love/hate relationship with smart watches. I think that having notifications on my wrist is pretty annoying.
I wouldn't want the watch to be more powerful than this (like an Apple Watch). I typically use a very minimal watch face.

At the same time, I think data can be pretty. Most watch faces that show a lot of data are overloaded with labels and icons.
They Cyberpunk aesthetic makes data overload fun. So that's what I made.

## Features

- Yellow indicates actionable information (daily goal progress, current activity, weather alerts)
- The second hand and hour indicator start from the bottom (midnight) to reflect the sun's position (although the watch does maintain clockwise movement rather than east-west movement)

Weather
- weather condition (blue or yellow)
- uv index (blue or yellow)
- precipitation chance (blue or yellow)
- humidity %
- current temp
- high / low temp
- wind speed and direction

Time
- time of day (am/pm or 24 hours)
- day of week (starting Sunday or Monday)
- date

Health bar
- daily goal number (number, green or yellow)
- heart rate
- daily goal percent (bar, green or yellow)
- body battery, with current and max
- current heart rate zone

Activity
- Training status
- Last activity (green or yellow)
