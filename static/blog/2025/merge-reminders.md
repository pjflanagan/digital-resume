I work solo on a lot of projects, meaning the only person to review my code is me.
Sometimes, when revisiting a project after a break, I forget exactly how to work on a project.
It can be helpful to leave comments behind, but those often get overlooked.

Now comments can become more powerful. By flagging a comment with `MERGE:` I can make
that comment appear automatically on a pull request.
