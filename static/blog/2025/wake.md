This past year I got into DnD. I love the game mechanics and I think dice look pretty.
I wanted to program something that captured the storytelling aspect of DnD.

So I programmed a game that "readers" to choose dialog responses and roll dice to determine outcome.

But the real magic is the editor. Using `react-flow` I was able to create a flowchart editing
system that shows the whole branching timeline of the game. My goal for the future is to allow anyone to
log in and write their own stories.
