My brother-in-law needed a musician website to be more findable. Rather than him paying for Squarespace I built him a website myself. 

Since the website is relatively simple, I wanted there to be a fun interactive feature. I decided the divider between the main photo and the sidebar would be a set of 4 pluckable bass strings.

Try moving your mouse across the strings to see them vibrate.
